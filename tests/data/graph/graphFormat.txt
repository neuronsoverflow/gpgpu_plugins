graph format example:
0 2 4 3 2
1 2 1
2 0 4 1 1 4 3
3 0 2
4 2 3

// In this file format, for example the first line,
// 0 2 4 3 2
// means that node 0 has an edge to node 2 of weight 4
// and an edge to node 3 of weight 2.

// NOTE that for the program, all graphs are undirected, so make sure that
// the graph file contains the edges "pointing" to both ways.
// example: in the example above, node 0 has an edge to node 2 of weight 4
//          so node 2 must also contain an edge to node 0 of weight 4.

// another NOTE: the program requires that all nodes start at index 0
//               and increase their node numbers by 1 (so 0,1,2,3,...)
